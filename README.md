# Mortality-Rate-Analysis-with-Data-visualisation-and-Statistical-analysis-Method
The project titled "Mortality Rate Analysis with Data Visualisation and Statistical Analysis Methods" focuses on analysing mortality rates using both data visualisation and statistical techniques. Key aspects include visualising data trends with Power BI and performing statistical analysis in R. Techniques such as correlation calculation, linear regression, and Holt-Winters time series analysis are used to identify patterns and relationships. The project also involves hypothesis testing using a one-sample t-test and paired sample test. Libraries like PerformanceAnalytics, Corrplot, Psych, TTR, and Forecast are employed for statistical modelling and interpretation of mortality data trends.
